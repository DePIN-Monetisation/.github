# DePIN Monetisation: FIRST Lavarage and Arbitrage OF Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks

Some cool people whom your truly Alkesei DOLGIKH didn't know, but will, start [project for depinscan.io for monitoring of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)](https://depinscan.io/) and I decide to start Project named DePIN Monetisation!
